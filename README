# Capistrano Version 3.0

This `README` is just here to tease anyone that looks too closely... Capistrano 3.0 is in the works.

I'm adding a `README` now to warn people that there will be catastrophic api changes that will break all plugins.

The reasons for all will become clear in time, however in the meantime don't worry about your deployments, you'll notice here on this branch is no `capistrano.gemspec`, and thus no gem release planned yet.
